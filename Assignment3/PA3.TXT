=====================================================================

1. Prolog  

All the text below should be cut and pasted into
a file called pa3prolog.pl. Follow the directions 
and include any queries requested. 

Complete the following predicates so that they
correctly model the relationships between the people 
listed below as facts.

Show that using your rules, you can infer that zues, 
rosa and fran are bitsy's cousins, and that bitsy and alan are
one-another's brother and sister. Also create queries that test
all predicates.

child(X, Y) :-

sister(X, Y) :-

brother(X, Y) :-
